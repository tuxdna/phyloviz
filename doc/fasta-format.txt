FASTA FORMAT:

A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line is distinguished from the sequence data greater-than(">") symbol in the first column. An example sequence in FASTA format is:

>MT dna:chromosome chromosome:NCBI36:MT:1:16571:1
GATCACAGGTCTATCACCCTATTAACCACTCACGGGAGCTCTCCATGCATTTGGTATTTT
CGTCTGGGGGGTGTGCACGCGATAGCATTGCGAGACGCTGGAGCCGGAGCACCCTATGTC
GCAGTATCTGTCTTTGATTCCTGCCTCATTCTATTA

Sequences which should be shorter than 80 characters in length, are expected to be represented in the standard International Union of Biochemistry-International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry(IUB/UIUPAC) amino acid and nucleic acid codes, with these exceptions:

- lower case letters are accepted and mapped into uppercase  letters
- a single hyphen or a dash can be used to represent a gap of indeterminate length
- and in amino acid sequences, U and * are acceptable letters

Before submitting a request, any numerical digits in the query sequence should either be removed or replaced by appropriate letter codes (e.g. N for unknown nucleic acid residue or X for unknown amino acid residue).

The nucleic acid codes supported are:

A --> adenosine
C --> cytidine
G --> guanine
T --> thymidine
U --> uridine
R --> G A (purine)
Y --> T C (pyrimidine)
K --> G T (keto)
M --> A C (amino)
S --> G C (strong)
W --> A T (weak)
B --> G T C
D --> G A T
H --> A C T
V --> G C A
N --> A G T C (any)
- gap of indeterminate length


For programs that use amino acids query sequences, such as BLASTP and TBLASTN, the accepted amino acid codes are:

A alanine
B asparate or asparagine
C cystine
D asparate
E glutamate
F phenylanaline
G glycine
H histidine
I isoleucine
K lysine
L leucine
M methionine
N asparagine
P proline
Q glutamine
R arginine
S serine
T threonine
U selenocysteine
V valine
W tryptophan
Y tyrosine
Z glutamate or glutamine
X any
* translation stop
- gap of indeterminate length
