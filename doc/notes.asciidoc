DNA/Protein Classification System

Notes: 

Search Internet for following notes:

 * clustalw phylogenetic tree file format
 * to view a tree, you can use the RETREE or DRAWGRAM/DRAWTREE programs of PHYLIP

The phylogenetic trees in Clustal W (the real trees that you calculate AFTER alignment; not the guide trees used to decide the branching order for multiple alignment) use the Neighbor-Joining method of Saitou and Nei based on a matrix of "distances" between all sequences.

To see a list of all the command line parameters, type: 

 * clustalw -options on UNIX
 * clustalw /options on VMS,MAC and PC the programs of Vingron and Argos (1991) 

TREES: DISTANCES:- The simplest measure of distance between sequences is percent divergence (100% minus percent identity).

HMMER

The original hmmt proÔ¨Åle HMM training program from HMMER 1 is also still available, from ftp://ftp.genetics.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/hmmer/hmmer-1.8.4.tar.Z.
